This project contains multiple utilities which can be used to unpack Hype: the Time Quest files, but should work with other games made by Montreal with the CPA engine (often mistakenly said to be the related OpenSpace engine).

Code inspired by:
https://github.com/szymski/Rayman2Lib/tree/master/csharp_tools/Rayman2Lib
https://github.com/BinarySerializer/BinarySerializer.OpenSpace/blob/main/src/DataTypes/Graphics/GF/GF.cs
https://github.com/byvar/raymap

Due to issues with making the game run on Linux, the project is currently discontinued, since I can't test any files I would have created.
If you're trying to mod Hype, your best bet is the Rayman modding community and the Rayman control panel app. The app unfortunately does not support some of the encodings used by Hype's GF texture format, so your mileage might vary.
